    <h2><a href="./Characters/leonnin.html">Leonnin</a></h2>
    <p>Tall and broad-shouldered, Leonnin carries himself with the steady 
        confidence of one who has sworn his life to a cause. His black hair 
        frames sharp hazel eyes, and his presence commands respect even 
        in silence. He dresses in dark purple, the color of devotion and 
        defiance, with a single glove marked by the triskelion—symbol of 
        Trithereon, god of liberty and retribution. A cleric of freedom, 
        Leonnin believes no chain is unbreakable and no tyranny unchallenged. 
        His faith fuels both his healing touch and his wrath in battle, 
        making him a steadfast protector of his companions and a relentless 
        foe to those who would oppress others.

    <h2><a href="./Characters/raven.html">Raven Silvarion</a></h2>
    <p>
        Raven is a figure of quiet intensity, her black hair swept to one side, 
        the other shaved close to the scalp. Dressed head to toe in fitted black 
        leather, she moves like a shadow between shadows. Two curved black 
        daggers rarely leave her hands, their edges glinting only in the 
        moment before a strike. Her demeanor is sharp, her silence calculated. 
        Where others charge or hesitate, Raven slips unseen, striking with precision 
        and vanishing just as swiftly. In a land filled with danger, she embodies 
        survival through cunning, speed, and skill.
    </p>

    <h2><a href="./Characters/cate.html">Cate Windrunner</a></h2>
    <p>
        Graceful and keen-eyed, Cate carries the aura of the wild with her wherever 
        she goes. Her long golden hair shines like pale sunlight, and her features 
        are marked by an otherworldly beauty that speaks of her elven heritage. 
        Clad in simple yet elegant traveling garb, she bears a finely crafted bow, 
        the weapon never far from her side. Cate’s bond with the natural world is 
        unshakable. She reads the forest as one might read a map, every sound and 
        sign speaking to her. In battle, her arrows fly swift and true, striking 
        from the treeline with deadly precision. To her companions, she is both 
        guide and guardian—an unerring pathfinder in the vast, snowbound wilds.
