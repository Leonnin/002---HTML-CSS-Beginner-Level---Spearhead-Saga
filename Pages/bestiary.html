    <h1>Bestiary</h1>
    <p>
        The isle of Spearhead is more than snow, stone, and pine. Its wilderness is alive 
        with creatures both natural and otherworldly, shaped by ancient magic and the unseen 
        hand of the Fey. Some stalk the forests in silence, swift and cruel; others crawl 
        from the depths of sea and cavern, alien in form and purpose. Whispers tell of twisted 
        beings once banished from the mainland, of predators clad in living armor, and of 
        Fey-born tricksters whose speed and malice defy mortal reckoning. Whether born of 
        cold earth, deep waters, or the shadows of the Feywild, these creatures mark the 
        island as a place of peril where every step beyond the firelight carries risk. Here 
        begins a record of what has been encounteredâ€”and what may yet await.
