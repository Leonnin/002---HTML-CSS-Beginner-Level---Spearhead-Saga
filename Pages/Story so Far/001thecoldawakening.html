    <h1>Session 1 - The Cold Awakening</h1>
    <p class="par-1">
        Cate and Leonnin awoke on a frozen beach, the cold seeping deep into their bones. 
        As they rose, they noticed the mangled bodies of the ship’s captains nearby—and 
        one dark figure being tossed about by the waves. Approaching cautiously, they 
        realized she was still breathing. Leonnin pulled her nearly lifeless body from the 
        water, and Cate urged him to carry her somewhere dry.
        <br>
        <br>
        The beach was short and jagged, strewn with rocks, and beyond it loomed an ancient 
        pine forest. In the far distance, a cone-shaped mountain rose, its slopes covered in 
        greenery. As they made their way toward the treeline, the dark-haired stranger stirred 
        painfully awake. Within the shelter of the woods, where it was slightly warmer, the 
        three introduced themselves. She was Raven, an elven woman with black hair and dark 
        eyes flecked with gold. Cate, another elf, bore long blond hair, piercing blue eyes, 
        and a pale cloak. The only human among them, Leonnin, stood tall and athletic, dressed 
        in robes of deep purple.
        <br>
        <br>
        Together they laid their wet clothes upon the underbrush to dry, as the trees here were 
        wide and their branches high above. Cate recalled fragments of memory—the ship they had boarded 
        bound for a city on this island, a name she could not fully recall but knew contained the word 
        Spear. The last thing she remembered was thick fog, sudden chaos, and then waking on the beach. 
        From their bearings, they concluded they must be on the western side of the isle.
        <br>
        <br>
        Returning to the beach in search of supplies, Leonnin noticed one of the captains stirring. At 
        the same time, Raven observed the shoreline rising into treacherous cliffs, the stone growing 
        steeper and harsher the farther it stretched. A heavy veil of fog rolled in, thickening by the minute. 
        Leonnin called for the others, and Cate rushed to stabilize the captain, forcing seawater from his lungs. 
        As they dragged him toward the forest, they discovered three barrels—two smashed and empty, but one 
        holding enough food for two days. Cate gathered branches, and they managed to light a fire.
        <br>
        <br>
        The man did not survive the night. At Raven’s insistence, Leonnin carried his body back to the beach 
        to keep scavengers away. When he returned, he brought salvaged clothing that would help them endure 
        the cold. Their own garments had dried only slightly. Darkness deepened, the fog thickened, and the chill 
        grew sharper. They decided to eat and build shelter. Cate found a large branch and, with vines and fallen 
        leaves between two trees, fashioned a crude camp. She took the first watch, stashing the food high in a 
        nearby tree.
        <br>
        <br>
        Within the first hour, Cate noticed two small shapes watching from the shadows. They showed no fear, and 
        as the hours passed, more little creatures gathered, hiding among the roots of trees. At dawn, she woke Raven, 
        passing on her watch. Certain the others were asleep, Raven searched their belongings. Leonnin’s right hand 
        was covered by an ornate glove, far finer than the rest of his gear, marked with the triskelion—surely a 
        divine symbol. Around his neck, she discovered a pendant. From Cate she noted a cloak of exceptional quality, 
        though it seemed to radiate a strange, dark energy. She replaced everything and returned to tending the fire 
        until dawn broke and the animals vanished into the deeper woods.
        <br>
        <br>
        Leonnin murmured prayers over his book while the women extinguished the fire and gathered their things. On the 
        beach, a thin layer of snow had fallen, though the wind had stilled, and the day seemed brighter. They agreed 
        to follow the forest’s edge southeast, toward the city. Cate took the lead. The shoreline was rugged, the cliffs 
        almost touching the trees. At one point, a section of stone collapsed, nearly sweeping them over, but none were 
        harmed. Below, they glimpsed seawater rushing into a hollow in the rocks, raising suspicion of a hidden cave. 
        Before they could investigate, the sound of splashing echoed nearby—followed by desperate cries for help, which 
        soon turned into screams. After a brief debate, they chose to continue onward. By sunset, they retreated into 
        the forest, set camp, and lit another fire.
        <br>
        <br>
        That night, Cate again took first watch. Hours passed in silence until movement flickered in the distance. Then 
        all was still again. In the third hour, Raven awoke, only to feel a net tightening around Cate. The ranger was 
        being dragged toward the cliff’s edge. Raven leapt forward, slashing the net apart with her daggers until Cate 
        broke free. Following the shredded rope, they spotted three humanoid figures with frog-like faces. Each carried 
        a wooden shield and spears strapped across their backs.
        <br>
        <br>
        Amid the chaos, Leonnin awoke and saw the creatures. Cate recognized them instantly—amphibious monsters she knew 
        had once been driven from the mainland into the underdark.
        <br>
        <br>
        The Battle
        <br>
        <br>
        Cate loosed an arrow at the first, wounding it. Raven’s arrow flew wide, and the second rushed her, but she dodged. 
        The first struck Cate with a spear, drawing blood, while the third lunged at Leonnin, wounding him. Leonnin struck 
        back with crushing force, nearly felling the creature in one blow. Cate and Raven attacked with daggers but missed 
        their marks. Leonnin finished the third and turned on the second. Cate rejoined the fight while Raven evaded attacks. 
        The first lunged again, biting into Cate’s arm, but Raven’s daggers ended it swiftly. The last attempted to flee, 
        but Leonnin’s hammer left it staggering. Cate forced it to the ground.
        <br>
        <br>
        As Cate and Leonnin dealt with the captive, Raven searched the fallen but found nothing of value. On the bound 
        frog-creature, however, she saw a tattered, bloodstained sailor’s shirt. It understood none of their words. In a 
        sudden surge of rage, Leonnin brought his mace down upon its skull, killing it instantly. For a moment, triumph burned 
        in his eyes—then sorrow, and the heavy weight of regret.
        <br>
        <br>
        Thus began the tale of Spearhead Saga.
