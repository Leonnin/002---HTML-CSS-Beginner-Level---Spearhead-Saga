    <p>
        Spearhead Landing is a somewhat large but still-growing town, built of 
        sturdy wood cut from the surrounding pine forests. Its snow-covered 
        streets are lined with simple timber houses and halls, their architecture 
        practical yet marked by the beauty of craftsmanship. Despite the cold, 
        the town has warmth of its ownâ€”taverns and hearths that welcome travelers 
        and locals alike. The most renowned among them is the Oak, Ash and Thorn, 
        a tavern known for its lively atmosphere and steady comfort. Overseen by 
        its innkeeper, Moloch, it serves as both gathering place and refuge, where 
        stories are traded as freely as mugs of ale.
