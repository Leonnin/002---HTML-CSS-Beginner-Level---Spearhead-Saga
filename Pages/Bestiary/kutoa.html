    <h1>Kuo-toa</h1>
    <p>
        The Kuo-toa that haunt the shores and river mouths of the isle are remnants 
        of a people long driven underground. Twisted by generations in darkness, they 
        have crawled back into the world through cracks and caverns, surfacing along 
        the western coast. Frog-like in form and unsettling in manner, these creatures 
        gather in small hunting bands, armed with crude spears and shields of driftwood. 
        Though dim-witted, they are relentless and cunning in their own way, often 
        ambushing travelers under cover of night or fog. Sailors whisper that some 
        wear the tattered remnants of stolen clothing, a chilling reminder of their 
        raids upon the unlucky. The people of Spearhead Landing know them as a dire omen: 
        where the Kuo-toa stir, worse things are never far behind.
