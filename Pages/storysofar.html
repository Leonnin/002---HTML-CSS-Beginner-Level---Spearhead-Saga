    <h1><a href="./Story so Far/001thecoldawakening.html">Session 1 - The Cold Awakening</a></h1>
    <p>
        Shipwrecked on the western shore of the isle, Cate, Leonnin, and Raven 
        awoke in the freezing surf with little more than their wits and scattered 
        supplies. Struggling against hunger, fog, and bitter cold, they made 
        camp and forged a fragile alliance. Their first night brought danger from 
        the forest’s edge—amphibious, frog-like creatures wielding spears. 
        Though wounded, the companions fought them off, marking both their 
        first victory and the beginning of their shared journey.
